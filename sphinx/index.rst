ModRover: Model Space Explorer
==============================

The **ModRover** package provides inference analysis across covariates and an
ensemble learner to generate better prediction. The methodology is inspired by
Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and we extend the original method to use out-of-sample
performance as the averaging criterion.
